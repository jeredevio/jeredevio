# Hi, I'm Jeremy 👋  
**Indie full stack developer — building tools, apps & SaaS solo** 💻

---

## 🧠 About Me

I'm a self-taught developer with a creative background in 3D and motion design.  
Now focused on building clean, useful and scalable digital products — solo.  

Learning by doing, shipping one product at a time.  
From small tools to full apps and SaaS.  
No clients, no fluff — just code and consistency.

📍 Started from €350 and a laptop.  
🎯 Goal: reach **€40K/month in 365 days** through real, recurring products.
